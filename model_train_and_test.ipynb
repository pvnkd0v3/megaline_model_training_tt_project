    "The following project uses pre-processed data from the Megaline mobile phone company detailing their customer's monthly beahviors (number of calls made, data used, etc.). The data is derived from customers who have already switched to one of Megaline's new phone plans (Smart or Ultra) and will be used to train several classification models. Each model will be fitted to predict which of Megaline's new phone plans should be advertised to customers who have not yet switched to one of the Smart or Ultra plans. The purpose of this project is to test each model for optimal accuracy by iterating through different combinations of hyperparemters in order to provide Megaline with the most accurate and time efficient model for targeted advertisement.

    "Three classification models (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and LogisticRegression) were tested using a validation dataset for their accuracy in determining which Megaline phone plan a customer will be drawn to based on monthly phone data. Furthermore, each model was tested using different hyperparameter arguements to determine each model's optimality. The DecisionTreeClassifier model was tested using different depths from 1 to 50, The RandomForestClassifier with different depths from 1 to 50 in increments of 10 and number of estimators from 1 to 50, and LogisticRegression with different solvers. The model that returned the highest accuracy score was the RandomForestClassifier with hyperparemeters depth set to 9 and the number of estimators set to 21. With the threshold for accuracy being 0.75, the RandomForestClassifier returned an accuracy score of approximately 0.792. Following was the DecisionTreeClassifier model with a depth of 7 returning an accuracy score of 0.790, and the LogisticRegression model using the newton_cg solver returning an accuracy score of 0.760. Ranges of hyperparemters can be increased to possibly achieve higher accuracy of the models at the cost of more time to run them, but in this case of time efficiency and optimal accuracy, it appears the RandomForestClassifier with a depth of 9 and 21 estimators should be used by Megaline to determine which of their new phone plans to advertise to customers who have not yet switched."
