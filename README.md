This is TripleTen's Sprint 7 Chapter 6 project on Machine Learning. Here I use pre-processed data (found in users_behavior.csv) from the Megaline mobile phone company detailing their customer's monthly beahviors (number of calls made, data used, etc.). The data is derived from customers who have already switched to one of Megaline's new phone plans (Smart or Ultra) and is used to train several classification models. Each model is fitted to predict which of Megaline's new phone plans should be advertised to customers who have not yet switched to one of the Smart or Ultra plans. The purpose of this project (executed in model_train_and_test.ipynb) is to test each model for optimal accuracy by iterating through different combinations of hyperparemters in order to provide Megaline with the most accurate and time efficient model for targeted advertisement.
